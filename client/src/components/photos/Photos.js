        <p>Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time.</p>

        <p>It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. The light is your friend. Preserve it. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. A big strong tree needs big strong roots.</p>

        <p>I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Have fun with it. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow.</p>

        <p>Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Here's something that's fun.</p>

        <p>Let's get crazy. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. There we go. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is.</p>

        <p>I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue Working it up and down, back and forth. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen.</p>

        <p>Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch.</p>
