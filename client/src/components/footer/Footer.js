        <p>If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. That's crazy. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day.</p>

        <p>There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Let's get crazy.</p>

        <p>Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown.</p>

        <p>All kinds of happy little splashes. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way.</p>

        <p>We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. Just make little strokes like that. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint.</p>

        <p>Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy.</p>

        <p>There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. And just raise cain. In your world you have total and absolute power. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world.</p>
