        <p>You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. Very easy to work these to death. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect.</p>

        <p>Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Get tough with it, get strong. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world.</p>

        <p>We don't have anything but happy trees here. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. Put it in, leave it alone. At home you have unlimited time. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it.</p>

        <p>Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it.</p>

        <p>With practice comes confidence. Every day I learn. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first.</p>

        <p>If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. This is unplanned it really just happens. You can spend all day playing with mountains. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there.</p>

        <p>Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be.</p>
