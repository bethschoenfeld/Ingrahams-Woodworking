        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. A little happy sunlight shining through there.</p>

        <p>You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. Every time you practice, you learn more. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school.</p>

        <p>If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. That's crazy. Use what you see, don't plan it.</p>

        <p>It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death. This is truly an almighty mountain. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. All you have to learn here is how to have fun.</p>

        <p>Now it's beginning to make a little sense. Imagination is the key to painting. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy.</p>

        <p>Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend.</p>

        <p>We have a fantastic little sky! And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. Only eight colors that you need. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. What the devil. Trees cover up a multitude of sins.</p>
